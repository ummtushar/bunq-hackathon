  "research": "It looks like there was a technical issue with the search tools. However, I can still provide concise money-saving strategies and common alternatives for each transaction based on best practices and typical options in the Netherlands:\n\n1. NS Train Ticket (\u20ac20)\n   - Consider off-peak travel, group tickets, or NS Flex subscriptions for discounts.\n   - Check for regional travel cards or discount codes.\n   - Use apps like \u201c9292\u201d or \u201cNS\u201d to compare ticket options.\n\n2. Zara T-shirt (\u20ac30)\n   - Look for similar styles at budget retailers like H&M, Primark, or C&A.\n   - Check online marketplaces (Vinted, Marktplaats) for second-hand or new T-shirts at lower prices.\n   - Wait for Zara sales or use student discounts if available.\n\n3. SPAR Coffee (\u20ac3\u20135 per cup, multiple times daily)\n   - Buy coffee at larger chains (e.g., Albert Heijn To Go, HEMA) which often offer cheaper prices.\n   - Invest in a reusable cup and make coffee at home or work\u2014significant savings over time.\n   - Look for loyalty programs or multi-buy deals at local cafes.\n\n4. McDonald\u2019s Meal (\u20ac10)\n   - Check for McDonald\u2019s app deals or meal combos.\n   - Try other fast food chains (e.g., Febo, KFC) for cheaper meal deals.\n   - Prepare similar meals at home for a fraction of the cost.\n\n5. Chicken Nuggets (Peer-to-peer, \u20ac4)\n   - Store-bought frozen nuggets from supermarkets (Jumbo, Albert Heijn) are much cheaper per portion.\n   - Buy in bulk and prepare at home for better value.\n\nSummary of Money-Saving Strategies:\n- Use discount cards, apps, and group deals for travel.\n- Shop at budget or second-hand clothing stores.\n- Make coffee and fast food at home, or seek out loyalty programs and promotions.\n- Reduce frequency of small daily purchases for significant long-term savings.\n\nIf you want specific current deals or promotions, let me know and I can try searching again!",
  "recommendation": "Make coffee at home, buy clothes on sale, and check travel discounts.\n\nYou can save a lot by preparing your own coffee instead of buying it multiple times a day\u2014try making it at home or work and bringing a reusable cup. For clothing, look for sales or shop at budget stores and second-hand platforms. For travel, check for off-peak or group ticket discounts before buying. Small changes in these areas can add up to big savings!"
